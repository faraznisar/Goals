# Goals
Everything I am planning on studying/exploring or already have starting 2023
1 - Next Js (been working with react long enough now and it's honestly getting boring)
2 - Javascript - Refresh my knowledge of Javascript because I honestly seem to have forgotten a lot of important stuff.
3 - Remix js - sounds amazing and worth looking into since It's kind of fresh.
4 - Node - Gotta jump into javascript on server sooner or later - NO RUSH
5 - Angular - used it back in 2020 for a couple months so maybe will be fun now - NO RUSH
